Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### Technology stack
 Built an IMDb clone using ReactJS and integrated the TMDB API to retrieve movie data, including movie titles, posters, release dates, and ratings. Implemented three filters to display popular movies, top rated movies, and upcoming movies.

 ### Project description
Developed a movie browsing app that provides users with a seamless browsing experience. Designed the app to display movie data in an easy-to-understand format, with the ability to sort by popularity, rating, and release date.

### Problem-solving skills 
Overcame challenges such as handling asynchronous data requests and implementing dynamic filtering functionality. Used React's component-based architecture to develop a scalable and maintainable app.

### Future plans 
Planning to add more features such as user authentication, personalized watchlists, and movie recommendations based on user preferences. Continuously improving the app to enhance the user experience and make it more robust.
